# üìä Student Placement Analysis: Visualizing Success Factors in Campus Hiring

## üîç Project Overview

**Student Placement Analysis** is a data-driven project aimed at uncovering the key academic and demographic factors that influence campus placement success. By analyzing a real-world dataset of over 1,100 students, this project provides actionable insights for educators, career counselors, and students.

* **Dataset**: 2,966 raw records ‚Üí 1,137 cleaned unique entries
* **Goal**: Identify major factors that contribute to successful student placements
* **Approach**: Data cleaning, EDA, and visual storytelling using Python

---

## üåü Objectives

* Understand dataset structure and quality
* Clean and preprocess for analysis
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Visualize trends and draw insights
* Guide institutional strategies and student decision-making

## üìà Key EDA Insights

| Factor               | Observation                                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Placement Rate**   | \~55% students placed; \~45% not                           |
| **Gender**           | Males slightly more likely to be placed                    |
| **Stream**           | CSE and ECE students have higher placement rates           |
| **Age**              | Most students are 21‚Äì22 years; age has minimal impact      |
| **CGPA**             | Strong positive correlation with placement                 |
| **Internships**      | More internships significantly boost placement probability |
| **Hostel Residency** | Slight positive impact on placement                        |
| **Backlogs**         | Major negative impact on placement                         |
| **Top Predictors**   | CGPA, Internships, Backlogs                                |

## üîç Visualizations Include

* Target Distribution
* Placement by Gender
* Stream-wise Placement
* CGPA vs Placement
* Internships Impact
* Backlogs vs Placement
* Correlation Heatmap

---

## üìå Conclusions

* **High CGPA** and **multiple internships** are strong indicators of placement success.
* **Backlogs** substantially reduce placement chances.
* **Stream** and **hostel residency** have moderate impact.
* **Age** is not a reliable predictor.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

* Encourage students to pursue **internships** early.
* Emphasize the importance of **academic consistency** (high CGPA).
* Support systems for students with **backlogs**.
* Customize career training by **stream-specific trends**.
